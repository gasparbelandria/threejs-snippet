# threejs practices

Just one week learning three js.

Topics learned:

* To create renderer, scene, camera, geometry, controls, and texture.
* Helpers.
* Add events to objects like 'click', 'mousedown'
* Change properties at objects.
* Scale, rotation and translation.

Next, I want to learn how:

* Change shapes.
* Camera effects.
* Set texture in a portion and not whole object.
* Merge primitives.
* To detect collisions.
* Management some scenes same time.

I'll update this README according topics learned.
