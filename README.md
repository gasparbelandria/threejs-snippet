Just one week learning three js.

Topics learned:

1) To create renderer, scene, camera, geometry, controls, and texture.
2) Helpers.
3) Add events to objects like 'click', 'mousedown'
4) Change properties at objects.
4) Scale, rotation and translation.

Next, I want learn how:

1) Change shapes.
2) Camera effects.
3) Set texture in a portion and not whole object.
4) Merge primitives.
5) To detect collisions.
6) Management some scenes same time.

I'll update this README according topics learned.
